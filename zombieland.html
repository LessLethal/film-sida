      Searching for family. In the early twenty-first century, zombies have
      taken over America. A shy and college student in Texas has survived by
      following his 30 rules: like "look in the back seat," "double-tap," "avoid
      public restrooms." He decides to travel to Ohio to see if his parents are
      alive. He gets a ride with a savage, brutal zombie-killer headed for
      Florida, and soon they confront a young woman whose sister has been bitten
      by a zombie and wants to be put out of her suffering. The sisters were
      headed to an LA park with atractions they've heard is without a zombie.
